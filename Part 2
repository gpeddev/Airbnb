This is Part 2 of the project.


An R Data Object, AirBnB data for assessed project, is provided
on Moodle with datasets from different cities from over the 
world. Within the datasets, you have information on Airbnb 
properties.

A separate file, AirBnB data desciption and sourceFile, has also 
been provided which contains a description of the data and 
information on the data source.

Using the techniques and methods you have learned so far in
this course, you will investigate these data by using appropriate
plots, summary statistics and formal tests to provide an 
exploratory and formal analysis of these data for two of the 
cities.

Please see the information at the top of Question 5 to find the 
two cities you have been allocated for the purposes of this 
project. For the remainder of this project please only use your
allocated cities.

Please upload any relevant plots, summary tables, and
statistical output (not R-code), alongside written comments to 
answer each of the following questions. You should also 
consider transformations of the data, where relevant.  Make 
sure to include written comments for all summary and 
statistical output produced to answer the questions of interest.

For each question, please upload a single file of solutions
(ideally a PDF) in the respective upload box. You should not 
upload your R-code.
